# Which-celebrity-do-you-look-like
My personal rendition of the facial recognition problem using CNNs. Inspired by the Gradient App.

See the data [here](https://gitlab.com/palaashagrawal29/which-celebrity-do-you-look-like):

The model uses a Resnet34 model that classifies trains to classify between different celebrities. This data has been curated from a wide variety of backgrounds - movie actors (hollywood/bollywood), TV personalities, sportspersons, YouTubers, musicians, and other famous people - 295 in total. 

Obviously, if you pass your own photo to the model, the model would try to match features from your face to a celebrity, and tell you which celebrity you resemble the most. See for yourself!
